| [Comparing synchronous and asynchronous online discussions for students with disabilities: The impact of social presence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131520300427) | The affordances of online learning have the potential to improve learning outcomes for students with disabilities by allowing customization and flexibility to meet individual needs. However, there are significant executive function and language processing demands that may be particularly challenging for this population. With that in mind, interventions guided by social presence theory may increase students' ability to engage in online settings. This study implemented a computer-mediated, blended classroom setting in order to assess students‚Äô understanding of statistics concepts following synchronous and asynchronous online, video-based discussion sessions. Social presence theory predicts that the immediacy of synchronous interactions should improve social presence, thereby increasing student engagement and performance. Data was collected from 105 students with high-incidence disabilities using a mixed methods experimental design with a within-subjects quantitative component. Our findings indicate that while students with disabilities expressed preference for synchronous discussions, including self-reported greater engagement and self-reported improved comprehension, their performance on assessments of conceptual understanding was slightly better following asynchronous discussions. Implications for these disparities between preference and performance are discussed. |
| [Virtual worlds for people with autism spectrum disorder: a case study in Second Life](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277407201_Virtual_worlds_for_people_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_A_case_study_in_Second_Life) | The purpose of this study is to explore the use of virtual worlds by people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with a particular focus on the virtual world Second Life‚Ñ¢. Case study methodology was selected to explore the experiences of Wolf, a participant with ASD, in Second Life. Wolf participated in three in-depth interviews. The interviews were analyzed using a content analysis to identify themes and sub-themes. Analysis identified four main themes: social factors and communication, empowerment, virtual world versus physical world, and social cues and body language. Anecdotally, Wolf's experiences suggest that people with ASD enjoy using a virtual world and may feel more comfortable communicating in the virtual world context than in the physical world. Virtual worlds offer a venue for people with ASD to be a part of a virtual society, lowering communication barriers experienced in the physical world, and providing a unique opportunity to create and maintain friendships. Virtual worlds offer an arena for people with ASD to meet their peers on equal terms, without being dependent on social cues, which can be a barrier for communication in the physical world. Further research in this area is required. Implications for rehabilitation include increased accessibility and comfort in virtual environments for people with ASD. |
