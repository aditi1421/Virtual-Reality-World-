| Title | Category | Abstract |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| [The role of social presence in online learning for students with disabilities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131520300427) | Social Interaction | - **Online learning helps students with disabilities** by offering customization and flexibility.  - **Synchronous interactions improve engagement**, but students performed better in asynchronous settings.  - **Challenges:** Executive function and language processing demands. |
| [Virtual worlds for people with autism spectrum disorder: A case study in Second Life](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277407201_Virtual_worlds_for_people_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_A_case_study_in_Second_Life) | Inclusion | - Study on how **people with ASD** experience virtual worlds (Second Life).  - **Themes identified:** Social factors, empowerment, communication, and body language.  - Virtual worlds **reduce barriers and allow ASD individuals to socialize comfortably**. |
| ["It's Just Part of Me:" Understanding Avatar Diversity and Self-presentation of People with Disabilities in Social Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11170) | Identity | - Study on how PWD perceive their avatars & whether they prefer to disclose their disability when presenting themselves in social VR.  - **Challenges** faced by PWD during the avatar customization process.  - **Design implications** to promote avatar accessibility and diversity. |
| ["I Try to Represent Myself as I Am": Self-Presentation Preferences of People with Invisible Disabilities through Embodied Social VR Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08193) | Identity | - Preferences of people with invisible disabilities (e.g., ADHD, dyslexia, chronic conditions).  - Invisibly disabled people approach avatar-based disclosure based on past experiences, considering **facial expressions and body language**.  - Defines a **binary framework** for disability expression (public vs. private) and outlines **three disclosure patterns** (Activists, Non-Disclosers, and Situational Disclosers) for designing inclusive VR experiences. |
|[Body, Avatar, and Me: The Presentation and Perception of Self in Social Virtual Reality](https://guof.people.clemson.edu/papers/body.pdf)|Self-presentation in online digital social spaces has been a long standing research interest in HCI and CSCW. As online social spaces evolve towards more embodied digital representations, it is important to understand how users construct and experience their self and interact with others' self in new and more complicated ways, as it may introduce new opportunities and unseen social consequences. Using findings of an interview study (N=30), in this paper we report an in-depth empirical investigation of the presentation and perception of self in Social Virtual Reality (VR) - 3D virtual spaces where multiple users can interact with one another through VR head-mounted displays and full-body tracked avatars. This study contributes to the growing body of CSCW literature on social VR by offering empirical evidence of how social VR platforms afford new phenomena and approaches of novel identity practices and by providing potential design implications to further support such practices. We also expand the existing research agenda in CSCW on the increasing complexity of people's self-presentation in emerging novel sociotechnical systems.
